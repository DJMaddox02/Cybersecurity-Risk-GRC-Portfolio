Control Findings

🔴 Least Privilege – Not Implemented

Status: Control Missing
Risk: Unauthorized access to customer data
Framework Mapping: NIST PR.AC

All employees currently have access to internally stored data including customer information, increasing breach likelihood.

Recommendation
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) enforcing least privilege principles.

🔴 Disaster Recovery Planning – Not Implemented

Risk Level: High
No disaster recovery plan or backup strategy exists, creating major business continuity risk.

Recommendation
Develop tested disaster recovery and backup procedures aligned with NIST Recover function.

🔴 Encryption – Not Implemented

Sensitive payment and customer information is stored without encryption.

Compliance Impact

PCI-DSS violation risk

GDPR exposure

Recommendation
Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

🟡 Password Governance – Weak

Password complexity requirements are minimal and no centralized password management exists.

Recommendation
Deploy password management solution and enforce strong authentication standards.

🟢 Effective Controls Identified

Firewall configured with security rules

Antivirus actively monitored

Physical security controls functioning
